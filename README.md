# StatisticalReports

This repo is a compilation of examples of technical writing for statistical problems, simulations, etc. from Statistics / Statistical Programming classes. Each report has three primary files: the R script used for exploring and completing the problem, the RMarkdown file used to generate the output, and an .html document of the actual final report.
